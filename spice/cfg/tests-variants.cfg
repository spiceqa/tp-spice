# All available tests variants for SpiceQE. This file servers as source for
# test names for Avocado.

## Test name conventions
## =====================
##
## #. The purpose of this file give a human meaning name.
## #. This name is used to uniquely address a test.
## #. The name is a unique test phase in the Beaker system.
## #. Test name should stay in correlation with TCMS Spice library.
